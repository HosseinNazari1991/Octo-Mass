Climate-responsive architectural exploration throughout the initial phases of building design.

Octo-Mass is an educational plugin currently in development at the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST).

This plugin primarily emphasizes the geometric characteristics of a building, such as proportions, ceiling number orientation, etc., in order to enable the creation of a generative model and the design of several alternatives according to user preferences.

This plugin includes additional components related to data analysis and geometric attribute measures.

This plugin is compatible with Ladybug tools and can exchange data with them.

This plugin is always under developing!
